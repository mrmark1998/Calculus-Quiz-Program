# Calc-Quiz-Program

This program was intended as an aid for me while tutoring calculus to my daughter.  She found it very helpful.

The program is an app-like quiz which tests the user on various high school calculus questions.  It is created using elements from Javascript, CSS, and HTML.  It is also able to store 5 of the highest score the user has ever achieved and their names, as well as display images along with the pertinent question.
